# Fluent Design Calculator

## Basic Techniques
* I use ![Fluent Reveal Effect](https://github.com/d2phap/fluent-reveal-effect#reveal-effect-library-fluent-design-system) on most UI effect. Btw, this JavaScript library is really awesome!
* It's a React website.
* Use 'yarn run start' to create a local server to show the website.
* Use 'yarn run build' to create production version.

## Feature
* As it shows, Fluent design makes it more beautiful.
* React is helpful on reducing code. Its main logic calculating code is seprating from UI code.
